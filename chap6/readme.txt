This folder contains the example code for Chapter 6.

The files and sub-folders within this folder consist of:

  src/               Source code for the server-side resources
  WEB-INF/           Deployment folder allowing this folder to serve as a Java web application
  jquery.js          jQuery library
  jquery.form.js     jQuery form plugin
  listing.6.1.html   The HTML file for listing 6.1
  listing.6.2.js     The script file for listing 6.2
  listing.6.3.html   The HTML file for listing 6.3
  listing.6.4.html   The HTML file for listing 6.4
  listing.6.5.js     The script file for listing 6.5
  listing.6.6.html   The HTML file for listing 6.6
  listing.6.7.html   The HTML file for listing 6.7
  listing.6.8.html   The HTML file for listing 6.8
  listing.6.9.html   The HTML file for listing 6.9
  prototype-1.5.1.js Prototype library

In order to execute, some solutions in this chapter require the services of
server-side resources. For your convenience, this folder has been configured
to be used directly as a Java web application without the need for building
or compiling the source code.

The server-side code requires the following:

  - a Java Web Server that is Servlets 2.4 and JSP 2.0 compliant
  - Java JDK 1.5

If you already have a suitable Servlet-enabled web server running, simply
set up an application context named /aip.chap6 whose docbase is this folder.
If you need to set up a free instance of Tomcat, please see the tomcat.pdf
document in the folder for the Chapter 4 example code.

These pages and classes have been tested in Safari 2.0, Firefox 1.5 and
Internet Explorer 6 and 7 except as otherwise noted.
